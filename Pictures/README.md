# Screenshots & Images

This directory contains screenshots and images for the Cloud-to-Ground Honeypot project.

## Naming Convention

Use descriptive names without spaces:

- `azure-sentinel-attack-map.png` - Main attack visualization map
- `rdp-brute-force-attempts.png` - Failed RDP login attempts visualization
- `n8n-workflow-overview.png` - n8n automation workflow screenshot
- `threat-feed-gist-output.png` - GitHub Gist threat feed example
- `log-analytics-workspace.png` - Azure Log Analytics configuration
- `honeypot-vm-dashboard.png` - VM dashboard in Azure Portal

## Organization Approach

For documentation, screenshots are referenced from this central directory:

```markdown
![Azure Sentinel Attack Map](Pictures/azure-sentinel-attack-map.png)
```

## GitHub Portfolio Integration

When adding this project to your portfolio site:

1. Copy relevant screenshots to your portfolio's `assets/images/projects/cloud-honeypot/` directory
2. Optimize images for web (reduce file size, use appropriate dimensions)
3. Consider creating a gallery/carousel for multiple screenshots

## Best Practices

- Keep images under 1MB when possible
- Use PNG for screenshots with text (better quality)
- Use JPG for photographs or complex images (smaller file size)
- Redact any sensitive information (IPs, account names, subscription IDs)
- Use consistent dimensions for similar images
